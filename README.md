# hello-world
My first step on Github

My first branche on Github


About me :

I have a mechanical engineering and project management background

I like the potential of programming to create beautiful and meaningful things with only lines of code

I love native mobile developpment : mainly swift on Xcode with cocoaPods

But also very good knowledge in HTML5, CSS3

And I am able to work with js, php and mySQL

I have used SaaS as Firebase (noSQL database) for my projects

If I have a small website to create I will certainly use WordPress or/and Bootstrap

I love sport : ski, motocrossracing, soccer, climbing...

I love competition, where I give everything I got

I am a very good listener and a fast learner, because I love to learn !!!

I admit, I like to exceed the expectations to impress people...

But I hate people too proud of themself

I like when the job is well done !

Last be not least, I love team spirit and people management : "working together is better"
